# Hit Point Roller

#### What is this?
This is an attempt to make a simplified version of Token Mold that slims down the feature set. The main feature is the ability to automatically roll hit points when a token is placed. And that's it!

#### But why?
Token Mold is currently (19/06/2023) broken on v11. Instead of waiting for a fix, I figured I would make my own version that simplifies the module down to the only feature I use from it. Since I was doing that anyway, why not release it to everyone.
